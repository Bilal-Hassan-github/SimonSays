# Simon Says Game

Simon Says is a classic memory game where the player must follow a sequence of colored lights and sounds in the correct order. 
The game challenges the player to remember an increasingly complex pattern of cues and repeat them without making mistakes. 
The game continues until the player makes an incorrect guess, at which point they lose and the game restarts.
